    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pasta is a versatile Italian food staple made from an unleavened dough of durum wheat flour (semolina) and water,
        often with eggs, formed into various shapes (spaghetti, penne, lasagna) and cooked by boiling or baking,
        serving as a carbohydrate base for sauces and dishes. Its texture and shape, 
        ranging from thin strands to wide ribbons and tubes, are designed to complement different sauces, 
        from light oil-based ones to heavy, creamy ragùs</p>
